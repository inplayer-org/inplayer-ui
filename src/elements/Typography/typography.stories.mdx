# Typography

Typography is an element which allows you to control the style of your text. 
It has a `variant` prop which allows you to choose between the h1-h6 headings. 
It inherits the `palette.primary.dark` text color, however this can be overridden by using styled-components.

```jsx
import { Component } from '@inplayer-org/inplayer-ui';

const Page = () => (
  <Typography />
)
```

<Props of={Typography}/>
