# StepWizard

A software wizard or setup assistant is a user interface type that presents a user with 
a sequence of dialog boxes that lead the user through a series of well-defined steps. 
Tasks that are complex, infrequently performed, or unfamiliar may be easier 
to perform using a wizard.

It requires `steps` array of object which contain `isDisabled`, `isCompleted` and `component`.


```jsx
import { StepWizard } from '@inplayer-org/inplayer-ui';

const Page = () => (
    <StepWizard />
)
```

<Props of={StepWizard}/>

### steps example:
```jsx
    const steps = [
        { isDisabled: false, isCompleted: true, component: <StepOne/> },
        { isDisabled: false, isCompleted: false, component: <StepTwo/> },
        { isDisabled: true, isCompleted: false, component: <StepThree/> },
        { isDisabled: true, isCompleted: false, component: <StepFour/> },
      ];
```
