Note is a component for displaying information for notification. <br />
The `type` attribute can be: informative, success, warning, danger. If not of the above is added, the default note with white background will be displayed. <br />
The `title` attribute is the string to be set as title for the notification. <br />
The `text` attribute is the actual notification that needs to be displayed to the user. <br />
The `icon` attribute is a string which represents a FontAwesome icon. It is not considered when there is a `type` prop passed. <br />

You can use it directly like this:

```jsx static
import { Note } from 'inplayer-ui';

function Page(props) {
  return (
    <Note
      type="success"
      title="Done!"
      text="This box indicates a successful or positive action."
    />
  );
}
```

### Demo

```jsx
<Note
  title="Just so you know!"
  text="This block indicates a neutral informative note."
  icon="info-circle"
/>

<Note
  type="informative"
  title="Just so you know!"
  text="This is used as a note on white backgrounds to give it a little contrast."
/>

<Note
  type="success"
  title="Done!"
  text="This box indicates a successful or positive action."
/>

<Note
  type="warning"
  title="Important note!"
  text="This box indicates a warning that might need attention."
/>

<Note
  type="danger"
  title="Danger!"
  text="This box indicates a dangerous or potentially negative action."
/>
```
